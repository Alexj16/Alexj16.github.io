            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p id="paragraphes">
            My name is Alexandre. I am a 29-years-old engineer. I was born France, and I completed most of my studies in Lyon and Strasbourg.
            During my studies, I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time in Germany and in Switzerland, where I improved 
            my skills in English and German. I have been living in Lausanne, Switzerland, for 3 years, where I started my
            career as Quantitative Biology Engineer.
            </p>
            <h2>My journey in the biotechnologies</h2>
            <p id="paragraphes">
            <img id="esbs-picture" src="static\images\esbs.png" width="300"> 
            I have always been interested in science, mostly biology.
            Therefore it was a natural choice for me to turn toward biotechnologies. I spent 7 years learning to work in the laboratory. 
            In engineering school, I developed an interest in molecular biology and genetics, and I had the chance to reach 
            the state-of-the-art of these fields thanks to a high-quality teaching form ESBS and IGBMC professor.
            After dedicating these years to biotechnology I decided to move forward into my second strong interest, 
            programming. I find it fascinating to merge lab work with computer science. 
            The emergence of high-throughput technologies creates a necessity for a new generation of biologists 
            capable of understanding the challenges of two fields which are so different but which have a lot to bring 
            each other. It is as a data scientist and quantitative biologist that I would like to steer my career.
            </p>
            <h2>My career in computer vision</h2>
            <p id="paragraphes">   
            <img id="heidelberg-picture" src="static\images\heidelberg3.jpg">        
            This challenge brought me to work in computer vision for bioimages analysis.
            First at Acquifer, I learned the basics of this new field for me under the direction of Dr L.Thomas.
            Then at Nanolive, I had the chance to do my master thesis under the direction of Dr M.Fréchin and then to work for 3 years as 
            Quantitative Biology Engineer. 
            <img id="lausanne-picture" src="static\images\lausanne.jpg">   
            This experience taught me the life in industry, its challenges, its work, 
            but it also gave me the opportunity to work on wonderful project in collaboration with my colleagues and 
            external partners. An scientific paper written in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute, and published in Nature Communications, summarizes perfectly 
            the culmination of my journey at Nanolive and the quality I reached. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49260-7" target="_blank">Dynamic label-free analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals virus-induced subcellular remodeling</a>

            <span> Apart from my work, I developed a passion for running. For 3 years, I have been training regularly and participating in 
            running events, such as Lausanne 20km three times, the Lausanne and Copenhagen half-marathons and the 100km of the Mt.Fuji International Marathon Winter Virtual Race. 
            My next upcoming challenge is an entire marathon for which I am training (and probably some other 20km+ race in between).

            When I find some free time, I enjoy hiking and visiting new places. 
            When I stay at home I spend most of my time reading, coding for myself and playing board games 
            or video games.
